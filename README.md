# Calculator

The final project for the Foundations Course in The Odin Project. 
The [specifications](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) are to create functions for each of the main arithmetic operations, work out all the kinks, and build a front end for it.
There's extra credit for making a decimal and a delete button, but I went the extra mile and added a button for modulus, negative, factorial, and exponents too.
I underestimated how much I would enjoy this project, and it truly put my problem-solving skills to the test.
